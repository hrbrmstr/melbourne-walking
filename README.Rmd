melbourne-walking is a small R project that is designed to:

- show how to scrape a web page for links
- download those links (without re-downloading on repeated runs) en masse
- read in a bunch of data files
- clean the resultant data frame
- munge the data for a vis 
- visualize the data
- compare raw R script vs Rmd vs Jupyter notebook

You can:

- Open the whole project in RStudio and run the R script, knit the Rmd file or spin the R script
- Run the `melbourne-walking.R` from the top level of the project folder via `Rscript R/melbourne-walking.R`
- Open `melbourne-walking.ipynb` in a Jupyter notebook with an R kernel

There are four output files:

- `melbourne-walking.html` showing the output from the Rmd knit
- `./R/melbourne-walking.html` showing the output from a "spin" of the R script
- `melbourne-walking-ipynb.html` showing what the Jupyter notebook output looks like
- `Rplots.pdf` which is a PDF version of running just the R script from the command line
